			<h4>Question Types</h4>
			<p>The tool has a collection of practice questions from each of the topics we have covered so far this semester. There are two types of questions:<br>
				<strong>Code Writing Questions</strong>: You are asked to write C code, which you then compile and run using the tool.<br>
				<strong>Code Reading Questions</strong>: You are shown a C program and asked to type into the tool what you think the output of the program will be.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<h4>Help!!</h4>
			<p>There are a number of ways the tool can help you if you're feeling stuck on a particular question. There are hint buttons for every question, where we have added a series of hints should you be struggling to find a correct solution to the question.</p>
			<hr>
			<h4>Work in Progress</h4>
			<p>This tool is a work in progress, so questions, hints and features will be added as we move through the semester.</p>
