      <!--			<h4>Introduction</h4>
			<p>
This website has been built by Anna Russo Kennedy and Anthony Estey as a tool to help students of UVic's CSC 110 study, practice and learn Java. Whether or not you use the tool wil have no effect on your grade. The tool is for your benefit only. </p>

      <h4>Question Types</h4>
      <p>The tool has a collection of practice questions from each of the topics we have covered so far this semester. There are two types of questions:<br>
        <strong>Code Writing Questions</strong>: You are asked to write C code, which you then compile and run using the tool.<br>
        <strong>Code Reading Questions</strong>: You are shown a C program and asked to type into the tool what you think the output of the program will be.
      </p>

      <h4>Help!!</h4>
      <p>There are a number of ways the tool can help you if you're feeling stuck on a particular question. There are hint buttons for every question, where we have added a series of hints should you be struggling to find a correct solution to the question.
        <!--As well, there is an "Ask a question" button, where you can ask any questions you have about the material or the tool, or report any problems you find. These questions are private between you and the teaching team, and will be answered by Anna or Anthony within a short time frame.-->
      </p>

      <h4>Work in Progress</h4>
      <p>This tool is a work in progress, so questions, hints and features will be added as we move through the semester.
        <!--Feel free to make suggestions or feature requrests via the "Ask a Question" button on any of the question pages.-->
